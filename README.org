* Installation
You will need Emacs 24+, `make` and [Cask](https://github.com/cask/cask) to
build the project.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
    cd bear
    make && make install
#+END_SRC
* Usage
To create a note
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
M-x bear:create-note
#+END_SRC

Which will prompt you for a
- note title
- tag string (eg. top-level/sub-heading1-sub-heading2)

Now you're in a markdown buffer, once done editing:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
C-c C-c
#+END_SRC

This /should/ pop open Bear.app with the note you have just created there
* Limitations
I indiscriminately convert all single quotes to double quotes to make
this work.  I imagine there are quoting bugs galore but so far haven't
run in into anything as my notes have simple title and content by and large.
* Extending
Add more functions and add them to the minor mode keybinding
* [[file:bear.el][Implementation]]
